# teamprofile

This project is a node.js application that is used for user input to create a index.html file that displays members of a development team. The user can populate the development team by going through the terminal and selecting a member of the team by including their name, position ID, and job that they do.

Main issues that I had with this project was my user input was working but it wasn't syncing to my html template page. I need to work more on this project to get it working properly
